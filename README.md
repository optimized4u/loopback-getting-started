# Coffee Shop Reviews

## Description

A project for users to register online, login and leave reviews for coffee shops, although it could easily be used for any type of review system.

I built this project by following the StrongLoop tutorials [Part I](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Getting+started+with+LoopBack)
and [Part II](https://docs.strongloop.com/display/public/LB/Getting+started+part+II).

> Personally I think from my initial limited experience with it, Loopback is going to radically speed up my fullstack cross platform app developement.

## Changes from tutorial

* All models use a local MongoDB through the mongoDs DataSource
* A mySQL DataSource is also provided, just change mongoDs to mysqlDs in ./server/model-config.json
* All static HTML is styled using Bootstrap with a Bootswatch theme (you can change themes).

## Changing themes

All available Bootswatch themes are listed in the projects ./client/index.html comments.
Simply change the theme named in the url which points to the css cdn.
Changing themes will not break anything (I hope). And is usefull for having a day (light) and night (dark) UI.

For example:
The url below is pointing to the darkly theme, simply change darkly to one of the themes listed.
<https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/3.3.6/darkly/bootstrap.min.css>

This url points to the yeti theme.
<https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootswatch/3.3.6/yeti/bootstrap.min.css>
